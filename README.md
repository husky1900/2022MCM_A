# 2022MCM
I participated in the 2022 Mathematical Contest in Modeling with two teammates and was awarded the Outstanding Winner. So we decided to record our essay and programs we wrote duing the contest.

We chose to work on Problem A and accomplished the mathematical model mainly using knowledge of physics and physiology. Due to the four-day time limit of the contest, we didn't have the chance to refine our model and polish the essay. Also I believe we had much to improve in optimizing our programs to carry out the algorithms we adopted with maximum efficiency.

# About the files
I have uploaded the .tex files as well as the template I used when writing this essay. By doing this I hope it will help beginners of mathematical modeling to write essays as I was helped.

Please feel free to contact me through email if thereâ€™re any queries.
